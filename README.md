Fizz Buzz kata in Kotlin with Property-Based Testing
=
For my first experience with Kotlin I selected the [FizzBuzz kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/), a simple exercise that is commonly used to practice TDD.

Also, I decided to property-based testing to test my code with automatically generated data.

I enjoyed writing code in Kotlin, and I will definitely repeat with different exercises.

Selected technologies
==
* Gradle is a build automation tool.
* JUnit 5 is a unit testing framework.
* AssertJ is an assertion library.
